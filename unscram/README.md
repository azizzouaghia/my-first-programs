# unscram

Enter a scrambled word and this program will unscramble it for you!  Only, it just prints out all combinations of the letters, so not very useful.  I did add some logic to try to highlight words that may be more likely to be correct.  I remember trying to find a dictionary file, but I couldn't get one - this was before I had access to the Internet.  I think I search our Word Perfect installation files, but I couldn't figure it out.
