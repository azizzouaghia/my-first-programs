# mastermind

A [mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) game I made.  This was fun and it was probably the game I made that I played the most.  Either this or [gomoku](https://github.com/ca98am79/my-first-programs/tree/master/gomoku), although I was more proud of gomoku because it had some intelligence.
