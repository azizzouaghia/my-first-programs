# diary

I created this diary program and had it run every time the computer booted up at our house.  So I have log entries from myself, my sisters, my parents and friends starting on July 13 1992.  The last entry is from my dad, who kept our old computer around for nostalgic reasons, dated Sept.10th, 2006.  If it weren't for him taking care of this computer, this stuff would have been lost.

It comes with a program READD.COM, which is used to read the log entries.
