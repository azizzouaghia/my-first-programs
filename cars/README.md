# cars

My epic car game.  It was my only [side-scrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-scrolling_video_game) game, and I only made four screens for it, so there is no way to win.  Maybe some day I or others can fork and continue the game, but it would take some work since the [sprites/inc files](https://github.com/ca98am79/my-first-programs/blob/master/cars/CARS.PAS#L2-L11) are missing.
