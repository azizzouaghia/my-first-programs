# baseball

A trick program that makes you think it is deleting all files on your drive.  I totally forgot about it and, after all these years, when I ran the program I totally fell for it.  I expected it to be a baseball game and was startled and freaked out for a moment, thinking it may have deleted my files.  Ha.

~~I can't find the source code.~~ [I found the source](https://github.com/ca98am79/my-first-programs/blob/master/baseball/TRICK.PAS) - it had a different filename.
